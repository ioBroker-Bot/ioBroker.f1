Formula 1 live data integration for ioBroker — provides race calendar, championship standings, session results, and real-time live session data via the [official F1 Live Timing feed](https://www.formula1.com/) and [Jolpica API](https://api.jolpi.ca/).

## Features

- **Race Calendar** — Next race & session info with countdown (days/hours)
- **Full Season Calendar** — All rounds of the current season as JSON
- **Championship Standings** — Driver and constructor standings with points and wins
- **Session Results** — Race, qualifying, sprint, and practice session results
- **Live Session Data** — Real-time data via F1 Live Timing SignalR WebSocket
  - Track status (AllClear / Yellow / SafetyCar / VSC / RedFlag)
  - Session status and name
  - Current & total laps
  - Time remaining / elapsed
  - Track weather (air temp, track temp, rain, wind, humidity)
  - Driver positions with gaps, lap times and tyre info
  - Top 3 live leaderboard
  - Race control messages
  - Pit stops
  - Tyre compounds per driver
  - Team radio

## Data Points

See the **Usage** section below for the complete object hierarchy and update intervals.

## Data Sources

| Channel | Source | Update |
|---|---|---|
| `schedule/` | Jolpica API (Ergast fallback) | Hourly |
| `standings/` | Jolpica API (Ergast fallback) | Hourly + after race |
| `results/` | Jolpica API (Ergast fallback) | Hourly + after session |
| `live/` | F1 Live Timing SignalR WebSocket | Real-time push |

## Requirements

- ioBroker >= 5.0.19
- Node.js >= 22
- Internet connection
- Stable connection to [Jolpica API](https://api.jolpi.ca/) or fallback [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mwapi/)

## Installation & Configuration

1. Install the adapter via the ioBroker Admin panel or command line
2. Open the adapter settings (no user configuration required by default)
3. The adapter automatically:
   - Fetches the current F1 season calendar hourly
   - Updates championship standings after each session
   - Provides real-time live session data when sessions are active
4. Optional: adjust update intervals in adapter settings if needed

### Data Sources & Consistency

The adapter uses multiple data sources with automatic fallback:

| Channel | Primary | Fallback | Behavior |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Schedule & Standings | [Jolpica API](https://api.jolpi.ca/) | [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mwapi/) | Updated hourly + after races |
| Results | Jolpica API | Ergast API | Updated after each session |
| Live Data | [F1 Live Timing SignalR](https://www.formula1.com/) | OpenF1 API | Real-time push during sessions |

**Note:** During race weekends, upstream APIs may temporarily deliver mixed-round data (e.g., standings updated before results). The adapter includes retry logic (6 attempts, 10-minute intervals) to ensure data consistency.

## Usage

Once installed and started, the adapter exposes ioBroker states under the object path `f1.0`:

```
f1.0
├── info.connection           (adapter connection status)
├── schedule/
│   ├── next_race_name / round / circuit / country / date
│   ├── next_session_name / type / date / countdown_*
│   ├── weekend_json          (all sessions of current weekend)
│   └── calendar              (full season as JSON)
├── standings/
│   ├── drivers               (JSON array with positions & points)
│   ├── teams                 (JSON array with constructor standings)
│   └── last_update
├── results/
│   ├── race / qualifying / sprint   (JSON arrays)
│   └── last_update
└── live/                     (only during session ±30 min)
    ├── is_live / session_status / track_status
    ├── laps_current / laps_total / time_remaining / time_elapsed
    ├── weather / race_control / top_three
    ├── drivers / tyres / pit_stops / team_radio
    └── last_update
```

States are updated:
- **Hourly** for schedule, standings, and results
- **Per-session** for result details (race, qualifying, sprint)
- **Real-time** for live session data (during active sessions)

## Troubleshooting

### "Points mismatch" during race-end window

During the first 60 minutes after a race ends, standings and results may briefly show different round numbers. This is expected behavior — the upstream API refreshes asynchronously. The adapter automatically polls for consistency (6 attempts, 10-minute intervals).

### No live data appearing

1. Check that a session is currently active (F1 Live Timing typically streams during practice, qualifying, and race)
2. Verify internet connection
3. Check adapter logs (ioBroker Admin → Instances → F1 → Logs)
4. If Jolpica API is unavailable, the adapter falls back to [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mwapi/)

### Stale data

Data is cached and updated on a schedule. If data appears outdated:
1. Manual trigger: restart the adapter instance
2. Automatic: next hourly refresh cycle will fetch fresh data
3. After a session: automatic refresh is triggered within 2 minutes of session end

## Data Sources & Attribution

This adapter relies on the following data sources:

- **[Jolpica API](https://api.jolpi.ca/)** — Ergast API mirror, primary source for F1 race calendar, standings, and results
- **[Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mwapi/)** — Historical F1 data, used as fallback when Jolpica is unavailable
- **[F1 Live Timing](https://www.formula1.com/)** — Official real-time session data via SignalR WebSocket
- **[OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org/)** — Fallback for live session detection
